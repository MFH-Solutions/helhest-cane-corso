  "About": {
    "title": "A little about me...",
    "description": "My love for the Cane Corso started in 2009, when I got my first dog of this breed. Before that, I had owned Dobermans and Bullies. But after experiencing this extraordinary dog, I couldn’t bring myself to own any other breed! After his passing, I got my second one, Jax, in 2016. He reignited my passion even more — I was obsessed! I wanted to know everything, see everything. I wanted the true Italian Cane Corso in all its aspects — both physical and temperamental. That’s when I started looking into importing a female to begin breeding. My Nera arrived from France in 2017. I was determined to build my breeding program on a solid foundation, with all the necessary health tests for the breed. The journey was long and challenging. I imported several dogs, some of which I had to remove from the program before I could truly begin. But I persevered. The dogs that form the foundation of my breeding program come from all over Europe (France, Serbia, Slovakia, Italy) to ensure I preserve the original heritage of the breed. My kennel is located in Val-des-Monts, Quebec, on a 40-acre property where my dogs have the freedom to roam and run in the forest daily as a pack. I run a small breeding program, producing approximately one litter per year. My dogs are registered with the Canadian Kennel Club, and I am a member of the Canadian Canine Club."
